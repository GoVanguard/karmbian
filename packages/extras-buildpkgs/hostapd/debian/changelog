wpa (2.6-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Cherry-pick the following patches from the upstream:
    - WPS: Force BSSID for WPS provisioning step connection
    - Check for NULL qsort() base pointers
    - Always propagate scan results to all interfaces
    - wpa_supplicant: Restore permanent MAC address on reassociation
    - nl80211: Update channel information after channel switch notification
    - Extend ieee80211_freq_to_channel_ext() to cover channels 52-64
    - Use estimated throughput to avoid signal based roaming decision
    - Use random MAC address for scanning only in non-connected state

wpa (2.6-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Restore the patch descriptions.
  * Don't install debian/system-sleep/wpasupplicant (originally introduced
    to fix LP: #1422143), it doesn't improve the state of the things,
    introduces regressions in some cases, and at all isn't supposed to
    work with how wpa-supplicant is started these days.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * wpasupplicant: install systemd unit (Closes: #766746).

  * import changelogs from the security queues.
  * move previous patch for CVE-2015-1863 into a new subdirectory,

  * replace the Debian specific patch "wpasupplicant: fix systemd unit
    dependencies" with a backport of its official upstream change "systemd:
    Order wpa_supplicant before network.target".
  * fix dependency odering when invoked with DBus, by making sure that DBus
    isn't shut down before wpa_supplicant, as that would also bring down
    wireless links which are still holding open NFS shares. Thanks to Facundo
    Gaich <facugaich@gmail.com> and Michael Biebl <biebl@debian.org>
    (Closes: #785579).

    - Remove newlines from wpa_supplicant config network output
    - Reject SET_CRED commands with newline characters in the string values
    - Reject SET commands with newline characters in the string values
  * use --buildsystem=qmake_qt4 (available since dh 8.9.1) for debhelper
    (Closes: #823171).
  * fix clean target, by splitting the find call into individual searches.
  * building wpa in a current unstable chroot using debhelper >= 9.20151219
    will introduce automatic dbgsym packages, thereby indirectly providing
    the requested debug packages for stretch and upwards (Closes: #729934).
    Don't add a versioned build-dependency in order to avoid unnecessary
    complications with backports.
  * change Vcs-Browser location to prefer https, but keep the unsecure tag for
    Vcs-Svn, as there is no option allowing to pull from the svn+ssh:// 
    location without an alioth account, this only makes lintian partially happy
    in regards to vcs-field-uses-insecure-uri.
  * debian/*: fix spelling errors noticed by lintian.
  * drop the obsolete Debian menu entry for wpa_gui, according to the tech-ctte
    decision on #741573.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add debian/system-sleep/wpasupplicant: Call wpa_cli suspend/resume
    before/after suspend, like the pm-utils hook. In some cases this brings
    back missing Wifi connection after resuming. (LP: #1422143)

      + hostapd: keep sqlite3 support disabled for the time being.
    - update debian/copyright manually, the wpa v2 branch was relicensed from
      (BSD-3-clause || GPL-2) to BSD-3-clause only (for the most part). This
      doesn't change the licensing state as the BSD-3-clause license is

  * use the readline6, wpa_cli doesn't link to openssl.
  * link with --as-needed.
  * compress binaries with xz.
  * debian/get-orig-source: switch to xz compressed upstream tarballs.
  * debian/get-orig-source: adapt for the post 1.x upstream branch.
  * debian/get-orig-source: support named snapshots, see debian/README.source
    for detailed syntax and semantics.
  * debian/README.source: explain fetching git snapshots by specifying their
    git hash.
  * debian/README.source: update to match current reality and apply grammar
    fixes.
  * debian/README.source: drop trailing whitespace.
  * fix hardening flags, thanks a lot to Florent Daigniere
    <nextgens@freenetproject.org> (Closes: #725865).
  * debian/control: fold dependencies.
  * bump standards version to 3.9.5, no changes necessary.
  * reflect reality and adapt the maintainer mail address not to claim
    representing Ubuntu.
  * drop wheezy-specific comments in the configuration files.
  * glob 'wpa-password' as well and hide its debugging output, this hopefully
    closes: #728092.
  * enable EAP-FAST, openssl in Debian is now new enough (Closes: #685685).
  * update to new alioth URIs (vcs-field-not-canonical).
  * add Keywords entry for desktop files (desktop-entry-lacks-keywords-entry).
  * functions.sh: s/particuarly/particularly/, thanks to Vincent Lefevre
    <vincent@vinc17.net> (Closes: #734422).
  * fix FTBS using gcc-4.8 by linking with -ldl on kfreebsd-any; the udeb
    packages don't provide EAP support and are therefore unaffected. This is
    already accounted for by the upstream Makefile, however wrongly depending
    on !CONFIG_DRIVER_BSD, while it is actually depending on the target libc
    rather than the kernel (Closes: #737465). Thanks to Cyril Brulebois
    <kibi@debian.org> and Steven Chamberlain <steven@pyro.eu.org>.
  * import "hostapd: Fix WDS VLAN bridge handling" by Felix Fietkau
    <nbd@openwrt.org> from upstream, thanks to Mark Hindley
    <mark@hindley.org.uk> (Closes: #737109).
  * drop build-conflicts with libqt3-dev as the package is no longer available
    >= lenny, thanks to Michael Biebl <biebl@debian.org>.
  * drop pre-dependency on dpkg (>= 1.15.6~), data.tar.xz-member-without-dpkg-
    pre-depends is no longer a problem after Ubuntu lucid is EOL. Thanks to
    Michael Biebl for noticing.
  * drop build-dependency on libdbus-glib-1-dev, it is no longer required for
    dbus-binding-tool, thanks to Michael Biebl.
  * allow parallel building.
  * fix spelling s/algorith/algorithm/.
  * add lintian overrides for false positive spelling complaints.

    build-dependency accordingly; all binaries are Multi-Arch=foreign.
  * update debian/copyright for wpa 1.0~rc2 and merged sources.
  * fix clean target and make sure to succeed building twice in a row.
  * drop build-dependency on libreadline-dev, it's no longer needed with
    WPA_CLI_EDIT.
  * remove watch file, there is no corresponding upstream tarballs at the
    moment.
  * add (temporary?) get-orig-source target to debian/rules, which fetches the
    last tagged upstream version corresponding to debian/changelog.
    - add a lintian override for this, upstream doesn't want to release
      tarballs at the moment.

  * Disable experimental feature CONFIG_IEEE80211W (management frame
    protection) due to it not being supported by any driver but ath9k
    and it generating ioctl errors which cause much concern among users
    for little to no benefit.
  * Add traling blank line to debian/NEWS to assist apt-listchanges as

    - wpa_msg_ctrl helper which can send messages to the control interface
      without logging when running in non-debug mode. Used for
      CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-RESULTS. (Closes: #539915) (LP: #352118)
  * Remove members of pkg-wpa-devel team from Uploaders who no longer
    participate in maintenance. Thanks for their past work. (Closes: #529501)
  * Disable building of atmel driver backend, neither atmel_{cs,pci},
    nor at76c50x-usb ever used it and atmelwlandriver is not in Debian
    and has been abandoned upstream in 2005. Thanks to Stefan Lippers-
    Hollmann for doing the research.
  * Remove a few traces of ath/madwifi from debian/NEWS and
    debian/README.Debian, thanks again to Stefan Lippers-Hollmann.
  * Prefix etc/pm/sleep.d/ pm-utils hook in the 50 - 74 sequence range to
    comply with sequencing rules as per pm-action(8) (LP: #307493). Provide
    the symlink to our hook in /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/ rather than
    /etc/pm/sleep.d/. (Closes: #557344)
  * Modify wpa_action and associated functions to use logger(1) instead of
    piping to /var/log/wpa_action.$IFACE.log.
  * Ensure removal of obsolete logrotate conffiles now that all
    wpa_supplicant/wpa_cli output is logged to syslog.
  * Support help action in action_wpa.sh. (Closes: #548995)
  * Build-depend on libreadline-dev instead of libreadline5-dev.
    (Closes: #553891)
  * Do not use sed to comment all network blocks out in the example
    wpa_supplicant.conf.
  * Do not strip upstream manual pages from source tree, do no generate
    them at build time, do not build-depend on dockbook. We currently do
    not modify them, so these build-dependencies and steps are expensive.
  * Convert debian/rules to use dh
    - build depend on debhelper (>= 7.4.12~) for dh override support, qmake
      build class support and --builddirectory argument support
    - install wpagui files via debian/wpagui.install
    - rename debian/ifupdown/wpa_action.sh to debian/ifupdown/wpa_action
      and install via debian/wpasupplicant.install
    - install wpasupplicant ifupdown scripts via debian/wpasupplicant.install
  * CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS and V are exported by debian/rules.
  * Remove uupdate command from debian/watch, it is not useful.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to debian/control for debhelpers to use as required.
  * Remove debian/get-git-snapshot and debian/rules target.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4, no extra changes required.
  * wpa_action shell functions no longer require an ifupdown state file
    to function as future providers of ifup/ifdown may not need or
    provide it.
  * wpa_action shell functions ifup and ifdown create and delete the
    wpa_supplicant sendsigs omission file thus removing the need for
    /etc/init.d/wpa-ifupdown. Remove /etc/init.d/wpa-ifupdown on upgrade
    via maintainer scripts. (Closes: #545173)
  * Drop debian/patches/10_multi_driver.patch due to its invasiveness -
    it may make future patches which fix serious issues harder to apply
    while providing an experimental feature only.
  * Add debian/patches/18_wpa_gui_wps_ap_avail_annoyance.patch to stop
    notifying about WPS_EVENT_AP_* events via wpa_gui tray status
    bubbles - they are too frequent.
  * Cherry pick 20_wpa_msg_ctrl_wps.patch from upstream to avoid too frequent
    logging of WPS events.
  * Drop debian/patches/05_qmake_version_makefile.patch, use qmake build
    class in debian/rules, Build-Depend on qt4-qmake and Build-Conflict
    with libqt3-dev.
  * Ensure wpa_supplicant/wpa_gui-qt4 is really clean, qmake seems to leave
    some crumbs (.obj, .moc & .ui).
  * Adjust debian/watch to scan for the 0.6.X stable releases only.
  * Remove debian/wpasupplicant.postrm - it is no longer needed to
    handle purge of log files, none are created anymore.
  * Enable make concurrency via dh --parallel option in debian/rules.

wpasupplicant (0.6.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add debian/patches/07_dbus_service_syslog.patch to enable syslog
    logging when wpa_supplicant is started via D-Bus.
  * Start wpa_supplicant with default level of verbosity via ifupdown
    hooks, rather than in quiet mode.
  * Merge some differences from wpasupplicant_0.6.6-2ubuntu1.patch, with
    very minor modification:
    - 12_syslog_supplement.patch: Add a few more bits missing from the
      upstream patch, based on
      http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/wpa_supplicant/OLPC-2/wpa_supplicant-0.5.7-use-syslog.patch.
      Compile with -DCONFIG_DEBUG_SYSLOG if CONFIG_DEBUG_SYSLOG is set in
      the configuration file.
    - Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SYSLOG in debian/config/* (rather than
      CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_DEBUG_SYSLOG).
    - debian/ifupdown/functions.sh: Silence wpa_log_* if /var/log is not yet
      writable; there is little we can do in this case (logger is in /usr,
      so may well also be unusable), and the user can always get more
      information by reconnecting later.
    - Thanks to Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>
  * Sync common build configuration options between debian/config/kfreebsd and
    debian/config/linux.

    as default in debian/rules. Purge
    debian/patches/04_append_mmd_to_default_cflags.patch.
  * Backport syslog support patch from 0.7.X development branch. Patch
    name is debian/patches/11_syslog.patch.
  * Backport patch from 0.7.X to allow multiple driver wrappers to be
    tried until one works. This will allow some kind of transition
    smoothing as drivers transition from wext -> nl80211 in the future.
  * Remove debian/patches/03_dbus_service_activation_logfile.patch,
    wpa_supplicant can now log to syslog instead.
  * Update copyright info in debian/ifupdown/*.
  * When starting wpa_supplicant via ifupdown hook script, do not log to
    file by default now that we have syslog support.

  * debian/ifupdown/action_wpa.sh: pm-utils now supplies a second
    argument to the hooks, thus telling ifplugd and pm-utils apart by
    the number of arguments does not work any more. Fix up the script
    to just evaluate the arguments themselves, to work with current

  * Add a shell script wrapper, debian/wpa_gui/netdev_wrapper, which will be
    used by the menu entry to try and exec /usr/sbin/wpa_gui with best
    estimated privilege level. Install it to /usr/share/wpagui/netdev_wrapper.
    [debian/rules]
  * Add 20_wpa_gui_menu_exec_path.patch to modify exec path of wpa_gui.desktop
    to point at our new wrapper, /usr/share/wpagui/netdev_wrapper.
  * Add debian menu file for wpa_gui, it also uses the netdev_wrapper.
  * Create xpm icons from new upstream icon build system, and store them in
    debian/wpa_gui/*.xpm to avoid creating them during package build because
    inkscape and imagemagick would be required which are quite large and
    uneccessary build dependencies. Leave a note in debian/rules to remind
    us about their origin and the reasoning behind this decision.
  * wpagui package Recommends: menu, as menu provides su-to-root, which we
    may need. [debian/control]
  * Add two upstream patches to improve the retrieval of scan results from

  * New upstream release
  * Retroactively cleanse past changelog entries of information indicating
    that they were not released, as they were.
  * Use short option for grep (-q) and sed (-n) instead of the busybox
    incompatible --quiet as per advice of Charles-Henri Gros.
  * wpa_action: on connected action, call wpa_hysteresis_event before
    ifup, so that a disconnected action may still be effective should
    the ifup take a long time (eg. dhcp request takes a long time and
    eventually fails).

    that the `debian/rules patch` command is required to prepare the source
    tree for building.
  * Cleanup debian/wpasupplicant.links, removing trailing whitespace and
    leading / from target symlink pathname.
  * Remove debian/README.Debian, the information therin was irrelevant for the
    current release cycle, and is better explained by the README.modes
    document.
  * Move debian/README.modes to debian/README.Debian, and create a backwards
    compat symlink (/usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/README.modes.gz ->
    README.Debian.gz) to avoid breaking current online documentation.
  * Fix spelling error in new debian/README.Debian found by lintian.
  * Don't install the wpa_supplicant/eap_testing.txt document, it contains
    information about development features and testing that is not possible
    with what is provided by the wpasupplicant package.
  * Remove the QMAKE variable from debian/rules, it is no longer used with
    upstream build system.
  * Remove debian/wpagui.install and instead invoke dh_install explicitly in
    debian/rules, making use of the WPAGUI variable, to have the correct
    version of wpa_gui installed (assist in switch to-fro different QT ports).
  * Remove possible bashisms (local(x, y)) from debian/ifupdown/functions.sh.
  * Add rudimentary locking system when wpa_action(8) calls ifup/ifdown, so
    that /etc/network/if-*.d/wpasupplicant can differentiate between admin
    calling ifup/ifdown or wpa_action. (Closes: #488078, #373180)
  * When wpa_action calls ifup/ifdown, use verbose command line option for
    more detailed log of what hook scripts are executed.
  * wpa-ifupdown.init should always stop wpa_action daemon, ifupdown is only
    guaranteed to stop it if interface is currently configured.
  * Move debian/README.Debian-source to debian/README.source, as policy seem
    to prefer this filename now as of version 3.8.0.

  * Span the Build-Depends field of debian/control over multiple lines.
  * Add debian/patches/13_defined_IEEE8021X_EAPOL.patch to allow compilation

  * Create debian/config/ directory to contain various build configuration
    files for different targets (eg. udeb, kfreebsd, linux).
  * Disable building of test driver backend, no development can sanely be done
    with this binary package.
  * Disable building of hostap driver backend, the version of hostap driver in
    existence since Linux 2.6.14 (or before) uses the wext driver backend.

    wpa-driver choice, and falls back to the usage of a default backend.
  * Modify debian/README.modes to not contain blurb about which driver_backend
    to use, wext should almost _always_ be used.
  * Refresh debian/patches/14_fix_compile_without_eap.patch with what was
    applied upstream.

    frequency information returned by mac80211 using drivers in ad-hoc mode.
  * 51_dont_reschedule_specific_scans_for_hidden_ssids.patch to optimize scan
    rescheduling in order to better detect hidden SSIDs.
  * Simplify debian/rules handling of wpa_supplicant/.config, just cp it in as
    needed in build target. Move dh_install into install target. These will
    make integration of possible future udeb cleaner.
  * Add 52_handle_mac80211_mode_switch.patch to enhance handling of mode
    switching for mac80211 using interfaces.
  * Add 53_give_adhoc_assoc_more_time.patch to give adhoc associations a bit
    more time.
  * Add 15_silence_out_of_bounds_warnings.patch to silence gcc-4.3 warnings
    about accessing out of bounds array index.
  * Purge debian/madwifi-headers/* and no longer activate the driver_madwifi
    backend of wpa_supplicant. Remove reference to it in support
    documentation. If "wpa-driver madwifi" is used in an /e/n/i stanza print a

  * Drop all patches applied to upstream git.
  * Add debian/patches/30_src_clean_existing_dirs.patch to adjust upstream

    script).
  * Make sure wpa_supplicant process is checked for and killed by wpa_action

  * Update debian/NEWS to alert users about the removal of the -w command line
    option.
  * Truncate debian/NEWS, none of the items are relevant for current upgrade
    paths, nor do they hold any historical relevance.
  * Clarify the license of the debian packaging. No license was initially
    given until now, so we could assume the original packager contributed the
    packaging under the same terms as the upstream license (BSD | GPL-2).
  * /etc/init.d/wpa-ifupdown must stop before sendsigs does when using

  * New upstream release.
  * Allow "wpa-key-mgmt NONE" to form a network block via the wpa_cli calls in
    wpa_conf() of functions.sh.
  * Overhaul wpa_key_check_and_set() function of functions.sh to better handle
    wep keys. Function now does similar checking of wep keys that it does for
    wpa keys. Valid wep keys can be hex of length 10|26|32|58 or ascii with
    length of at least 5.
  * Check wpa_cli return value in wpa_cli() function of functions.sh.
  * Adjust Standards-Version to 3.7.3, no extra changes required.
  * Switch to quilt patch management from dpatch:
    - build-depend on quilt, adjust debian/rules accordingly
    - debian/madwifi/mk-madwifi-header-patch becomes obsolete, removed
  * Remove debian/defconfig.sh, and re-impliment it in patch form again, but
    this time with a patch management system that can be used more naturally.
    This also allows an oppurtunity to go over our default build
    configuration.
  * Add svn:ignore property for .pc quilt by-product.
  * Ensure src/drivers/driver_madwifi/ directory is purged from source tree in
    clean target of debian/rules.
  * /var/lock/wpa_action.*.lock was not used in a version of wpasupplicant
    package in a stable release, no longer need to handle its removal in
    postrm anymore.
  * Activate support for PC/SC interface for smartcards along with SIM and AKA
    EAP methods. Build-depend on libpcsclite-dev. Suggest pcscd.
  * Update email address in debian/ifupdown/wpa_action.8 manpage.
  * Sanitize whitepsace in debian/README.modes, swapping tabs for 8 spaces,
    improving layout of basic tables. Fix a couple of typo's too.
  * Clarify in debian/README.modes the URI to BTS discussions. Also add a note
    that using ap_scan=2 requires explicit security policies to be set for
    each network.
  * dbus-wpa_supplicant.service now provided by upstream.
  * Impliment debian/examples/wpa_supplicant.conf.template in patch form. It
    is planned to expand this small template into a more usable and
    documented beginning point for the wpa-roam schema.
  * Add useful comments to the new wpa-roam.conf example configuration file.
  * README.modes now gives sound advice to setup the roaming daemon to be used
    with the netdev group, and offers advice on howto set various data
    sensitive conffiles to be readable only by owner. (Closes: #428620)
  * wpa_gui manpage exists in upstream, remove debian/wpa_gui.8.
  * If the path to ctrl_interface directory can be determined from the
    supplied configuration, do not append the -C option to wpa_supplicant
    start-stop-daemon command in ifupdown.sh. This breaks the new DIR= GROUP=
    ctrl_interface syntax.
  * Add initial subsection to README.modes about "Interacting with
    wpa_supplicant with wpa_cli and wpa_gui".
  * Activate CONFIG_IEEE80211R, CONFIG_IEEE80211W and CONFIG_EAP_WSC in the
    default build configuration.
  * Log wpa_supplicant output to /var/log/wpa_supplicant.$IFACE.log per
    default when using ifupdown to manage wpa_supplicant. wpa_supplicant
    supports logging somewhere via -f cli option. (Closes: #317180)

    scripts.
  * Enhance README.modes with new supplicant debugging methods.
  * Build the wpa_gui-qt4 variant now that it doesn't require qt3 support
    code. It also closes all child windows on File->Exit. (Closes: #426924)
  * wpasupplicant now Suggests wpagui.
  * wpa_action now logs to an interface specific logfile, and the logrotate
    rule was updated to take care of both the old and new locations.
  * Update copyright headers of ifupdown scripts, also add a few more code
    comments, a statement of purpose and package ownership as well as some
    other trivial cleanups.
  * Remove upgrade removal of conffiles from wpasupplicant versions that exist
    in oldstable and before. The preinst part of the upgrade handling was
    removed in pkg-wpa commit r852.
  * Create sendsigs omission pidfile in /lib/init/rw/sendsigs.omit.d/ for
    wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli processes managed by ifupdown. Determine
    runlevel when wpa_cli roaming daemon is active, and allow ot to be killed
    in runlevels 0 and 6. This allows wpa_supplicant process to survive until
    networking is stopped. (Closes: #401645)
  * Add debian/patches/03_dbus_service_activation_customise.patch to start
    wpa_supplicant with "-f /var/log/wpa_supplicant.log" per default.
  * Add debian/patches/30_scan_even_when_disconnected.patch to allow scan
    request to succeed even when interface is in disconnected state.
  * Modify debian/copyright to be machine-interpretable. Annotate all
    copyright holders in new format.
  * State clearly in debian/copyright that the BSD license has been chosen by
    us, the maintainers, as there is no exception to link against OpenSSL in
    the text of the given GPL-2 license.
  * No license had been chosen for the debian packaging information, so GPL-2+

wpasupplicant (0.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Kel Modderman]
  * New upstream release.
    - restructured source layout
  * Adjust debian/wpasupplicant.examples, debian/wpagui.install,
    debian/wpasupplicant.install, debian/wpasupplicant.manpages, and
    debian/wpasupplicant.docs for new layout.
  * Redjust debian/patches/30_dbus_policy.dpatch and
    debian/patches/40_debian_doc_examples.dpatch to apply against new layout.
  * Drop debian/patches/10_config.dpatch and
    debian/patches/21_madwifi_includes.dpatch.
  * Introduce makefile fragment for wpa_supplicant .config creation. Call it
    from debian/rules. It is named debian/dot.config.mk.
  * Add WPADIR variable to debian/rules, adjust build and install targets to
    use WPADIR.
  * Update madwifi_headers patch with code from current madwifi SVN trunk.
  * Damage control: allow 'wpa-conf managed' to pass through without failure
    for those people who followed the poor example outlined in the hidden
    ssid's section of README.modes. Also remove the offending line from the
    documentaion. (Closes: #428137)

  [Reinhard Tartler]
  * Fix building wpagui.
  * remove debian/wpasupplicant.preinst, since we don't support upgrades
    from oldstable. This way we don't need to look at /var/lib/dpkg/status
    anymore, which is unreliable anyway. Makes lintian happy.

    interface. (Closes: #403301, #403313)
  * Fixes EAP-PEAP/TTLS/FAST to use the correct EAP identifier in tunnelled

  * Drop deprecated init script example. debian/wpa_supplicant.init-daemon.
  * Drop debian/patches/10_orinoco_wep_key_fix.dpatch as the appropriate
    driver fix has been included in mainline linux since 2.6.19-rc.
  * Drop debian/patches/21_madwifiold_20060207_includes.dpatch,
    madwifi-old is deprecated upstream.
  * Remove false instructions from NEWS file regarding madwifi-old support
    that has since been discarded from the source package.
  * Drop debian/patches/11_erroneous_manpage_ref.dpatch,
    applied upstream.
  * Remove wpa-stakey code from conf_wpasupplicant() in functions.sh since it
    is removed from upstream.
  * Allow 'wpa-essid' to do the same thing as 'wpa-ssid'. (Closes: #403316)
  * Update Uploader: email address.
  * Update private madwifi includes to r2156 of madwifi.org SVN trunk.
  * Make a large note in README.modes wpa-roam documentation that a
    ctrl_interface MUST be defined for the roaming setup to function.
    (Closes: #407936).
  * Activate wpa_supplicant's dbus interface by installing
    dbus-wpa_supplicant.conf to the appropriate location. (Closes: #412179)
  * Add debian/patches/30_dbus_policy.dpatch to allow access control to
    wpa_supplicant's dbus interface via the netdev group. (Michael Biebl).
  * Install a service file to /usr/share/dbus-1/services/ for dbus aware
    applications that may take advantage of that in the future (Michael
    Biebl).
  * Add support to ifupdown.sh for `wpa-mode' and `wpa-frequency' options used
    in IBSS mode. Note that ifupdown.sh does not do any sanity checking for
    the other many requirements for using wpa_supplicant in IBSS mode.
  * Update XS-Vcs-* fields in control file, add Vcs-Browser token.
  * Move debian spcific ifupdown sh glue into debian/ifupdown/.
  * Have prerm gracefully bring down interfaces under the influence of
    wpa_supplicant via wpa-ifupdown init script.
  * Remove unrequired `unset' usage in wpa-ifupdown.init, discard stderr of
    find invocations.
  * Don't stop dbus wpasupplicant daemon via wpa-ifupdown.

  * Add XS-X-Vcs-Svn field to debian/control file.
  * Shunt env var IFACE to WPA_IFACE in the ifupdown.sh, wpa_action.sh and

  * Update madwifi headers to latest SVN. (Closes: #388316)
  * Remove failed attempt at action locking. [debian/functions.sh,
    debian/wpa_action.sh]
  * Add hysteresis checking functions, to avoid "event loops" while
    using wpa-roam. [debian/functions.sh, debian/wpa_action.sh]
  * Change of co-maintainer email address.
  * Add ishex() function to functions.sh to determine wpa-psk value type in
    plaintext or hex. This effectively eliminates the need for the bogus and
    somewhat confusing wpa-passphrase contruct specific to our scripts and
    allows wpa-psk to work with either a 8 to 63 character long plaintext
    string or 64 character long hex string.
  * Adjust README.modes to not refer to the redundant wpa-passphrase stuff.
  * Add big fat NOTE about acceptable wpa-psk's to top of example gallery.
  * Strip surrounding quotes from wpa-ssid if present, instead of just whining
    about them.

wpasupplicant (0.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * wpa_supplicant(8) now describes the -P (PID file) line option in the
    manpage. (Closes: #381721)
  * wpa_passphrase(8) is clearer about describing its purpose.
  * Start a paragraph in README.modes containing information about best
    security practises while using and configuring wpa_supplicant. For now
    it briefly covers the topic of file permissions. (Closes: #382241)
  * Implement PSK and ASCII passphrase key sanity checking, and warn user
    about suspicious key lengths (managed mode only).
  * Add leading example network conf, using wpa-passphrase, to README.modes.
  * README.Debian documentation changes as sugested by Eduard Bloch
    (Closes: #382314)
    - reordered sections by importance for a new user, this ensures wext info
      for ipw drivers is obvious (Closes: #384299)
    - rewrote the first chapter to give a fluent introduction, refered to
      wireless-tools doc
    - add missing .gz to README.notes path (Closes: #386603)
  * Reshuffle of README.modes, moving How It Works section toward the latter
    end to avoid stopping people from missing out on important info.
  * Rename 'Notes About Managed Mode' to 'Important Notes About Managed Mode'.
  * Clarify the status of madwifi and 'wext' in README.modes.
    (Closes: #382651)
  * Return exit status of daemon start commands.
  * Further cleanup of ifupdown.sh, move functions to head of script.
  * wpa-ifupdown no longer checks interface state.
  * Touch logfile before redirecting output to it via exec, to make sure it is
    writeable.
  * Split common code into /etc/wpa_supplicant/ifupdown_common.sh, so that
    ifupdown.sh and wpa_action.sh may share it.
  * Add 'wpa_action iface check' option, to test if interface is under
    influence of wpa_cli or not..
  * Start wpa_cli daemon from post-up to avoid a race condition with the
    roaming daemon where association occurred before the master interface
    state was recorded. This would cause the mapped logical interface to fail
    on ifup, as wpa_action would fail to detect the state of the master
    interface, thus not supply the --force option. This is where a stateless
    ifupdown would really help.
  * Make conf_wpa_supplicant no-act for roaming daemon. This is important, so
    that we do not attach wpa_cli to the ctrl_interface socket and initiate
    roaming before state is tracked.
  * Add hints about 'auto' and 'allow-hotplug' options with respect to the
    roaming interface in README.modes. (Closes: #384501)
  * Drop patchset for commenting out large wpa_supplicant.conf, use sed
    instead.
  * Active dbus interface via CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE_DBUS, add build-dep of
    libdbus-1-dev to debian/control.
  * Upstream now provides a connect-to-open-ssid example in the large
    wpa_supplicant.conf file, therefore there is no need to maintain such an
    example. Rename wpa_connect_open_ap.conf to wpa_supplicant.conf.template
    and adjust docs to use this as a starting point for the wpa-roam daemon.
  * Install wpa_passphrase to /usr/bin, there is no need for it in early boot.
  * Build qt4 wpa_gui from wpa_gui dir rather than pure qt4 variant
    (wpa_gui-qt4) as per Jouni's advice.
  * Add versioned dependency on lsb-base >= 3.0-6 for use of log_action_* in
    wpa-ifupdown.init. (Closes: #386164)
  * Use correct terminology when describing wpa-roam in wpa_action(8).

wpasupplicant (0.5.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support to wpa_action.sh and ifupdown.sh for allowing external mapping
    logic to be used as opposed to the id_str logic. Thanks to Felix Homman
    for the great insight while implementing this feature.
  * Add a timeout loop of max 60s when waiting for an action to finish.
    [wpa_action.sh]
  * Minor cleanups wrt code comments and function placement in ifupdown.sh.
  * Suggest guessnet, now that it can directly "plug in" to wpa_action. Also
    demote iproute from Recommends to Suggests, it is not important by any
    means and was only added to honour a wishlist request.
  * Prepare for ctrl_interface socket changes in 0.5.5. It can be provided by
    'DIR=foo GID=bar' or 'ctrl_interface=foo' in wpa_supplicant.conf. Our sed
    check for this path in ifupdown.sh should now support both alternatives.
  * Move LOCKFILE and LOGFILE into WPA_ namespace. [wpa_action.sh]
  * Use semi-colon instead of comma for verbose output as that seems to be a
    standard among many different applications.

wpasupplicant (0.5.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * UNRELEASED
  * Further optimisation of ifupdown.sh, use return values in
    init_wpa_supplicant() to dictate if further commands should follow, rather
    than exiting immediately.
  * Standardize echo'ing in ifupdown.sh. Add a wpa_msg() function to take care
    of "verbose|action|stdout|stderr" messages.
  * Add a 5 second timeout loop to init_wpa_supplicant() that waits for the
    ctrl_interface socket to be established before allowing wpa_cli to launch,
    and avoid a race condition. This means other functions no longer need to
    test for existence of the ctrl_interface socket. [ifupdown.sh]
  * Rename WPA_DRIVER to WPA_SUP_DRIVER to conform with name scheme of other
    similar variables. [ifupdown.sh]
  * Add (untested) wpa-bridge support to ifupdown.sh. This is an experimental
    upstream feature.
  * Major refactoring of wpa_action.sh, with all related commands put into
    independent shell functions.
  * Improve feedback from wpa_action.sh when used interactively. Give usage
    statement instead of simply returning "insufficient parameters".
  * 'wpa_action reload' is logged after the action. It is called interactively,
    and should also give interactive feedback. Same for 'wpa_action stop'.
  * Remove superfluous check for /var/log, and put logging initialisation into
    its own function, log_init(). [wpa_action.sh]
  * Shut `ip addr flush dev "$IFACE" up', it almost always has nothing to flush.
  * wpa-ifupdown init script now takes care of all interfaces while displaying
    only one line.
  * Don't set -e in wpa_action.sh. wpa-ifupdown script no longer takes exit
    status into account, and I'd prefer to account for all possible avenues of
    exit possible and log all encountered problems.
  * Really fix #375599, by containing the CTRL_IFACE_DIR path in WPA_SUP_CONF
    always, customised or not. The WPA_CTRL_IFACE socket was not being created
    when ommitted from the wpa_supplicant.conf file.
  * Add 'wpa-maint-debug' to enable set -x in ifupdown.sh, so that we can easy
    track down vague problems.
  * Slightly modify the way in which madwifi is activated. The default config
    we apply does not activate madwifi by default any longer, it is done via
    seperate patches; 20_include_madwifi modifies the .config file to activate
    the driver_madwifi backend, and adds the required CFLAGS to find the
    includes that are later added via one of the 21_madwifi*_includes patches.
  * Update madwifi includes to that of the current offering in the debian
    archive, r1680.
  * Implement basic locking for wpa_action action's for when the user callable
    "stop" action is executed while wpa_action is busy configuring the device.
    The wpa_cli daemon is killed, then wpa_action waits for the current action
    to finish gracefully before killing wpa_suppliant. This helps avoid
    inconsistencies with ifupdown when volatile conditions are experienced as
    part of the roaming setup (for example, driver problems causing connection
    loops).
  * Rename WPA_CLI_ACTFILE to WPA_CLI_LOCKFILE in ifupdown.sh.
  * Condemn the use of wpa-action scripts:
    - add NEWS item describing the superior alternative: wpa-roam
    - remove example action scripts
    - remove conf_wpa_cli() from ifupdown.sh
  * Condense README.Debian and NEWS, so that they contain only relevant items,
    and do not repeat the same information.
  * Massive enhancement of README.modes, in an attempt to relay the
    information about how this package, and wpa_supplicant work in debian with
    the greatest of clarity.
  * Harden tests for daemon pidfiles. No longer be satisfied that a pidfile
    exists, but use start-stop-daemon to test its validity by sending a signal
    0. Remove pidfiles that do not pass the test.
  * Fix stupid $DAEMON_VEROSITY typo that was used consistently throughout
    script. [ifupdown.sh]
  * Assoctiate "down" with the stop action of wpa_action.
  * Thanks Marc Haber for reading over docs and notifying of some of the
    follwoing issues.
    - Fix typo "automattically" in README.modes.
    - Remove bogus pre-up example from wpa_action(8) and README.modes
    - Explain in more detail how /etc/wpa_supplicant/ifupdown.sh works in
      README.modes.
  * Add "The Logfile" section to README.modes.
  * Add patch from upstream to fix writing of stakey, peerkey, and id_str
    network configuration variables into the configuration file when
    update_config=1 is set. Thanks to Felix for reporting.

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * End testing period. The 0.5 branch of wpa_supplicant upstream has proven
    to be non disruptive to users' configurations over the past few weeks,
    lets now allow this to propogate to testing. (Closes: #374342)
  * Clean up the LSB Init header block. Provide all fields as per LSB Init
    Script Comment Convention specification.
  * Do not use /usr/bin/env to interrogate the environment for IF_WPA
    variables, /usr may not be mounted at time of invocation. Use `set'
    (shell built-in) instead. (Closes: #376243)
  * Exit if IFSTATE_FILE or INTERFACES_FILE do not exist. Also, look for
    ifstate file in /var/run/network to remain compatible with Ubuntu's
    ifupdown divergence. (lp#51351)
  * Add a similar IFSTATE_FILE test to wpa-ifupdown.init, to remain compatible
    with Ubuntu. (lp#51351)
  * Update wpa_action.8 with the behaviour of wpa_action when IFSTATE_FILE or
    INTERFACES_FILE cannot be found, and the pathnames searched for their
    existence.
  * Mention wpa_cli(8) in Custom Action Script section of README.Debian, as it
    contains information about environment variables available to the script
    at runtime.
  * Also clarify dhclient wpacli-action script usage, to avoid people
    mistakenly cp'ing the skeleton script.
  * Add some info about howto revert installation of deprecated init script to
    NEWS file.
  * Add 'wpa-verbosity' switch, so that setting 'wpa-verbosity 1' in an
    interfaces stanza will cause wpa_supplicant's ifupdown hook to be loud.
    This was overlooked when #361586 was closed some time ago.
  * Remove return value hack in wpa_action, use set -e to exit on error
    instead. (Closes: #376553)
  * Not only flush IFACE when iproute is installed, but also use /sbin/ip to
    set 'up' operstate as well.
  * Default to wext without exception. Remove the check for wireless extensions
    via /proc/net/wireless, and prevent driver type of "wired" from being
    selected in the case that the iface may not be "prepared" yet.

  * Further env variable testing cleanups to ifupdown.sh.
  * Global rename of WPA_COMMON_CTRL_IFACE to WPA_CTRL_DIR, as this is used
    for the same purposes upstream.
  * No longer penalise users for not having ctrl_interface explicitly
    contained within their wpa_supplicant.conf. (Closes: #375599)
  * Move WPA_ACTION_SCRIPT sanity checking into init_wpa_supplicant() to avoid
    ifupdown.sh exiting when bringing down an interface when ifup previously
    failed due to a missing or non-executable action script.
  * Add numerous code comments to ifupdown.sh.
  * Move WPA_CLI_OPTIONS and WPA_SUP_OPTIONS into their respective init()
    functions.
  * wpa_action now logs 'stop' events to file, updated manpage.
  * Split wpa_action logging into two parts, event and environment. Only
    wpa_cli events will echo env var's.
  * wpa_action exits with retval of ifdown command on 'stop' event.
  * Add workaround for sendsigs (initscripts) terminating wpa_supplicant
    processes before networking is shutdown gracefully. An init script
    wpa-ifupdown is called at sequence number 15 in runlevels 0 and 6 to bring
    down all interfaces that were started via ifupdown.sh.

  * Update madwifing_includes dpatch to latest madwifi.org svn.
  * Add WPAGUI to debian/rules, so that only one change has to be made to use
    a different wpa_gui target. Remove $(WPAGUI)/Makefile in clean target.
  * Purge and forget about the old init example script.

wpasupplicant (0.5.3+20060522-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream development snapshot.
  * Oops: Disable CONFIG_EAP_SAKE. (Closes: #366937)
  * Rename debian/wpasupplicant.ifupdown to debian/ifupdown.sh. There is no
    need for that script to be named that way, as it may falsely seem to be
    handled by a debhelper target.
  * Don't attempt to send terminate signal via wpa_cli when start-stop-daemon
    can be used.
  * Use debhelper 5 compat level.
  * Use wpa_gui-qt4, and build-depend on libqt4-dev.
  * Use WPA_ID instead of NW_ID to make variable similar with what upstream
    uses for a similar purpose (unique identifier).
  * Add ifupdown environment var's to verbose output to assist in debugging.
  * Fix some typo's (engine_id, key_id) in ifupdown.sh.
  * ifupdown.sh no longer busy-loops when using an action script with
    wpa-action-timeout 0. Thanks to Elmar Hoffmann!
  * Allow wpa_cli action daemon to engage before configuring wpa_supplicant
    via wpa_cli set_network commands to avoid a possibly racy condition.
  * Move VERBOSITY variable to the beginning of ifupdown.sh, with the others.
  * Indent shell code in wpacli-action-* scripts.
  * Bumb Standards-Version to 3.7.2.
  * Allow for future PHASE specific stuff in start MODE of ifupdown.sh.
  * Move the action script sanity checks out of init_wpa_supplicant into
    common section of ifupdown.sh.
  * Create wpa_cli_wrapper to assist in major code clean up and future
    maintenance of ifupdown.sh.
  * Support madwifi-ng private ioctl's with the inclusion of the headers from
    madwifi.org svn trunk. (At the expense of not supporting the madwifi-old
    driver, which is deprecated by upstream madwifi)
  * Add wpa_action.sh to provide /sbin/wpa_action and facilitate roaming via
    ifupdown and network settings defined in /etc/network/interfaces (refer to
    wpa_action(8) for more details).

wpasupplicant (0.5.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream development release.
  * Orphaned daemons that are spawned during an ifup process that is
    manually terminated are now checked for and killed.
  * Don't make noise when we are not using the manual inet method and
    wpa-action is used.
  * Warn about non-executable action script.
  * Ensure wpa_cli actfile is destroyed.
  * Make start-stop-daemon verbose when VERBOSITY is set.
  * Renumber dpatches for sanity.
  * Make ifupdown script modular; split into shell functions.
  * Fix typo in README.Debian, referring to a non-existant location.
  * Disconnect and terminate existing ctrl_interface sockets.

wpasupplicant (0.5.2-3) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Remove bad information about wpa-driver-file in docs.
  * Actually fall back to wext as DRIVER type in example init script.
  * Fix typo in debian/control, remove suggests of dhcp*-client alltogether.
  * Remove bogus commands to set eapol_version and fast_reauth. They cannot be
    set via wpa_cli.
  * Make preauthenticate a global wpa_cli setting, rather than a per-ssid one.
  * Kill dhclient process after a DISCONNECT signal in dhclient action script
    example.
  * Document that the action script must must be executable.
  * Fix check for wireless extensions for when there is not whitespace after
    $IFACE:.
  * grep for $IFACE in /proc/net/dev to verify it is a valid network interface.
  * Improve documentation about wpa-driver, and further clarify that all
    wpa_cli commands should be supported in e/n/i by prefixing them with
    "wpa-".
  * Add a note about wpa-action-timeout.

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]
  * remove last reference to /etc/default/wpasupplicant. It is gone, don't
    revive zombies!
  * small cleanups in debian/rules
  * further clarifications in README.Debian

wpasupplicant (0.5.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Bump debian revision to upgrade over the previously version uploaded to
    experimental, which has sufficiently changed since that time to warrant
    rebasing the package upon the 0.4.8-1 release to unstable.
  * Make ifupdown script exit silently when binaries are not found or
    executable.
  * When ifupdown exits with an error status, do not hide the echo'd problem
    description behind the VERBOSITY environment variable.
  * Remove check for wpa_cli pidfile when executing an action script. This
    check was racy, and not always successful. Sometimes, the device was
    marked as up without allowing the action script a chance to finish.
  * Improve feedback for wpa_cli action script daemon.
  * Ensure WPA_CLI_ACTFILE is removed when wpa_cli is terminated.
  * Fix typo in ifupdown script that later propogated into some example
    information in README.debian (wpa-apscan should have been wpa-ap-scan).
    Provide backwards compatibility for this change for those who already
    followed the example.
  * Check for existing pidfiles before executing daemons via ifupdown.

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]
  * enable driver test
  * add eap_testing.txt to documentation

wpasupplicant (0.4.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]
  * Finally bringing in the new Upstream version with the ap scan patch for
    wpa-cli, required by network-manager (Closes: #356072)
  * Dropping Mode 3 (start by init script) (Closes: #356842, #357760)
  * add hint for associating to hidden ssids (Closes: #358137)
  * add a note for faciliating debugging connection problems
  * add this note to README.modes as well.
  * remove or backup obsolete conffiles
    /etc/network/if-p{re-up,ost-down}.d/wpasupplicant
  * install the wpasupplicant.conf(5) manpage (Closes: #358138)
  * don't start wpa_supplicant for loopback interface (Closes: #359814)
  * add explanation about action scripts, mentioning that we expect now
    the action script to create a file indicating that the interface is ready
    for use.
  * add warning in NEWS.Debian that upgrading to this package requires
    manual intervention by the local admin.
  * move old 'default configuration' to /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/examples
    as example for connecting to open APs.
  * remove version restriction from preinst. This means that obsoleted
    conffiles are always removed!
  * moved the ifupdown script to /etc/wpa_supplicant/ifupdown.sh
  * added note about binaries beeing moved to /sbin

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Undo 0.4.8-0ubuntu2's replacement of the preinst/postinst/postrm triad,
    which replaced the upgrade-failure proof and policy compliant code with
    "something else".
  * Restore change to ifupdown script that makes "wpa-conf" unnecessary.
  * Move /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
    if the user has modified it, otherwise remove it and install the new file.
  * Remove 0_ from if-*.d symlink names as we don't force an order or
    even serialisation.

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Remove check for /proc/net/packet. (Closes: M#37121)
  * Add timeout loop when launching a wpa_cli action script in conjunction
    with the manual inet METHOD, to allow other ifupdown hooks to
    post-configure the interface just as they would have if using a standard
    method such as dhcp or static. Introduce WPA_CLI_ACTFILE to allow a
    wpa_cli action script to signal connected state to ifupdown.
  * Add skeleton wpa_cli action script to examples.
  * Simplify wpasupplicant.examples.
  * Don't install wpa_supplcant.defconf as the default wpa_supplicant conffile,
    our users don't want that file interrogated by anyone, even dpkg.

wpasupplicant (0.4.8-0ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

  [ Kel Modderman ] - done in debian experimental for version 0.5.2-1
  * New upstream release.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Convert to cdbs.
    - rewrite debian/rules to take advantage of cdbs
    - update control file build-deps
  * Update README.modes.
    - clarify that wext is used by default, when no driver is specified
    - fix exmaple of wpa-psk using a plaintext string
    - fix typo's
  * Fold pre-up scripts into one, and symlink from
    /etc/network/if-{pre-up,down}.d/wpasupplicant
  * Use VERBOSITY of ifupdown to assist debugging of wpa stanza's in
    /etc/network/interfaces.
  * Add support for wpa_cli action scripts.
  * Use start-stop-daemon to initiate wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli background
    processes.
  * Daemons now create pidfiles.
  * Quote tested var's in wpasupplicant.init.
  * Quote all var's in wpsupplicant.default for uniformity.
  * Move wpa_* to /sbin.
  * Conffile for wpa_supplicant now installed to
    /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf. That directory will hold any
    other files that we may require to use wpa_supplicant.
  * Don't start wpasupplicant pre-up if the current kernel lacks support for
    "Packet Socket" (CONFIG_PACKET=y).
  * Fix blunders in the init script.
    - typo, $PIFFILE should have been $PIDFILE
    - init script exited when a configuration file WAS found
  * Force init daemon's pidfile to be the same as wpasupplicant.ifupdown uses,
    to avoid duplicate wpa_supplicant processes binding to the same interface.
  * Remove the margin for error from the init daemon, by forcing the default
    variables to be set. Helpful and informative comments were placed in the
    default file. The init script will exit if these variables are not set
    correctly. (Closes: #357957)
  * Add comment to defconf about ctrl_interface and wpa_cli.
  * Add comments to previously uncommented dpatch's.
  * Include proof-of-concept dhlcient wpa-action script. Suggest
    dhcp(3)-client.
  * Thanks to Henrik Brix Andersen from gentoo for the ideas and inspriration
    for some of the above changes.

wpasupplicant (0.4.8-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Various bug fixes
    - Support for EAP-FAST key derivation using other ciphers than
      RC4-128-SHA for authentication and AES128-SHA for provisioning.
    - UVF exception granted by Kamion.

  * Packaging and configuration is based on Debian Experimental however,
    making this package something of a bastard love child of what's in
    Debian.
  * Deliberately dropped support for wpasupplicant being run at startup to
    make it easier for Ubuntu to support.  It's now run on a per-interface
    basis when the interface is brought up.
    Consult /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/README.Debian for documentation
    if upgrading from universe.
  * Unlike Debian the wpa-conf /etc/network/interfaces is only needed for
    explicitly giving a configuration file; simply include any setting
    for wpa to be used.
  * Binaries moved to /sbin for seb128.

  * Convert rcS.d script to use /etc/network/if-p{ost-down,re-up}.d
    instead. Remove the rcS.d script installed in 0.4.7-0ubuntu{1,2}.
    If you manually modified /etc/network/interfaces to use the pre-up

    Thanks to Scott James Remnant for the guidance. (Closes: #304032)

  [Kel Modderman - submitted via bug #353530] (Closes: #353530)

  * Use upstream manpages.
  * added watch file
  * cleanups in debian/rules
  * Install wpagui manpage to man8
  * Use qmake-qt4 directly, to avoid ftbfs on systems with other qt
    versions installed.

  [Reinhard Tartler]

  * Merged with ubuntu package
  * added myself to Uploaders
  * use debhelper 5
  * remove debian/wpasupplicant.conffiles, debhelper handles this on its own
  * renamed ChangeLog.gz to changelog.gz, (Policy 12.7)
  * installed lintian override for possible multiple calling of update-rc.d.
    This is necessary to support different upgrade paths.
  * revised postinst, so that updating initskript links happens in when
    configuring the package only
  * introduce debian/NEWS, documenting importants bits of debian/changelogs,
    and a bit about future development of wpasupplicant
  * verified working WPA EAP-TLS on ipw2200. (Closes: #317548)
  * /etc/init.d/wpasupplicant is now a initscript which is not started on

  * New upstream version. (closes: #347347)
  * New binary package, wpa_gui; build-deps on Qt4. (closes: #332654)
  * Move wpasupplicant to run in rcS, before networking. This will likely
    upset a few people, but as wpasupplicant can wait for the interface to
    exist before doing anything, it shouldn't cause any real problems.
    (closes: #310136)
  * Document in default config file that EAP-FAST will not work
    without a patch to OpenSSL. (closes: #322174)
  * Comment out most of the default config file, some people kept the
    whole file verbatim, causing OpenSSL to try and load some uncommon
    libraries people likely didn't have installed, resulting in
    wpasupplicant segfaulting (closes: #330138, #336423)
  * Also for #336423, Suggest: libengine-pkcs11-openssl, and document why.
  * Make more noise when the daemon fails to run. (closes: #346265)
  * Don't advertise that -i may not be required in default/wpasupplicant,
    this option was removed as it did not scale to handle multiple
    interfaces. (closes: #322175)
  * Document typical location of config file in manpage. Note,

wpasupplicant (0.4.6-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (closes: #335487).
  * This version is designed for Wireless Extensions 19 and so will work
    with Linux kernel 2.6.14.  Closes: #338131.
  * Note that WPA support was added in Wireless Extensions 18 and should
    therefore exist in new (2.6.14-compliant) drivers, including
    ipw2200 v1.0.8. In order to take advantage of this new support you need to
    invoke wpasupplicant with the wext driver ("-D wext" in
    /etc/default/wpasupplicant for instance, instead of "-D ipw" say).
    Probably closes also #304087 and #317548, but I'm not going to confirm
    that just for an NMU.
  * Added comments to README.Debian amounting to the above.
  * Borrowed some of Norbert Preining's improvements:
        - add debhelper token to postrm script
        - fix address of FSF in copyright file
        - bump standards version to 3.6.2
        (Kyle, when you get back to this package, find Norbert's other changes
        upgrading to debhelper 4 in bug #338131).
  * Set NMU version to 0.2 for Norbert's convenience.
  * Marked /etc/init.d/wpasupplicant as a conffile (should really use
    debhelper4 to take care of this, but I'm not going to make the other
    changes needed for this).
